# CrawlDriver
while selenium web driver is a great tool for testing, The API's it provides lack methods to readResponse status.

Thus current project will have a webdriver which can also be used for crawl.

The interfaces exposed by this webdriver will be slightly changed to add new methods such as fetch() getCurrentUrl() modifyHeaders() etc..

The current project is Inspired by  "Ghost Driver" which is a webdriver for phantomjs.  This current WebDriver will work with PhantomJS alone for now. but people can contribute to this by adding new drivers
